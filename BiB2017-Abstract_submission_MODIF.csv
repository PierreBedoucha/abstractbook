Ribosome profiling reads show distinct patterns of read length distributions around translation initiation sites. These patterns are typically lost in standard ribosome profiling analysis pipelines, when reads from footprints are adjusted to determine the specific codon being translated. Utilising these signatures in combination with nucleotide sequence information, we build a model capable of predicting translation initiation sites and demonstrate its high accuracy using N-terminal proteomics. Applying this to prokaryotic translatomes, we re-annotate translation initiation sites and provide evidence of N-terminal truncations and extensions of previously annotated coding sequences. These re-annotations are supported by the presence of Shine-Dalgarno sequences, structural and sequence based features next to N-terminal peptide evidence. Finally, our model identifies 61 novel genes previously undiscovered in the Salmonella enterica genome.";ribosome profiling, bacterial translation initiation, machine learning, N-terminal proteomics, proteogenomics;12017/09/04 1:41:31 PM UTC+2;Anne-Kristin Stavrum;anne-kristin.stavrum@uib.no;Post doc;K2, UiB;Identification of molecular mechanisms following cannabis exposure in patients with psychosis ;Cannabis is the most widely used illegal drug worldwide.

NATs catalyze the reaction of transferring an acetyl group from the cofactor Ac-CoA to the N-terminus of a substrate protein (N-terminal acetylation). This is one of the most common modifications in eukaryotic cells. Despite the high structural conservation of the GNAT fold, universally shared among NATs, there are at least seven types of NATs described so far that differ in substrate specificity, catalytic strategies and cellular localization. It is essential to analyze the variation in catalytic mechanisms employed by the NATs in pursuance of understanding their functional diversity and predicting the specificity of uncharacterized members of the group. We use sequence similarity networks to analyse large datasets of NAT sequences in order to better characterize and understand the sequence-structure-function relationship of this diverse group of enzymes.

This study confirmed that only the C-terminal part of NatF (Naa60182-242) is important and sufficient for the membrane association.  As the resolved structure is missing the C-terminal part (Naa60185-242), we modeled this part based on the secondary structure predictions (PSIPRED and JPRED), which give two alpha helices in this region. These helices were analyzed by helical wheel and found to contain amphiphatic characteristic by containing a hydrophobic face on one side and a hydrophilic face on the other side. The modeled structure was then used to investigate the membrane association by molecular dynamics simulations. Results of an implicit membrane model (IMM1) simulations show that Naa60185-242 associate with the membrane at the interfacial position and both helices keep their predicted hydrophobic face partially anchored in the hydrophobic core of the membrane. The energy contribution from the anchored amino acids is favorable. To further investigate the detailed interactions we performed atomistic simulations using the Charmm force field. Naa60185-242 was docked on three membrane compositions, two anionic (POPC:PI4P 92:8, POPC:POPS 75:25) and one neutral POPC:PSM:CHOL 70:20:10. Results for all three compositions will be discussed in terms of density distribution and detailed interactions showing a favorable association for anionic membranes.

";;;;;;;;"Immunoscore is a relatively new concept based on immune reactions in the tumor microenvironment and is increasingly utilized to describe the interplay between tumor and host immune system.";;;;;;;;"Most clinical cancer-related studies investigating effect of medications are performed on patients after they have received at least one course of chemotherapy. How the treatment impacts tumor biology and the immune system in untreated patients has rarely been examined.";;;;;;;;The aim of this study is to identify how selected agents affect the immunoscore in treatment naí¿ve patients with HGSOC.;;;;;;;;Methods;;;;;;;;"In the current Window-of-Opportunity study the immunoscore will be examined in a prospectively enrolled cohort of 32 women who proceed to have debulking surgery after laparoscopy. Starting the day of laparoscopic surgery, these participants will be treated with selected agents for 10-14 days. The treatment will be discontinued at the time of tumor reductive surgery. During both surgical procedures tissue samples from matching sites will be obtained. Blood, saliva and urine will be sampled at inclusion, after laparoscopy and before the main operation.";;;;;;;;"Cytometry by Time of Flight (CyTOF) is a method that enables researchers to perform single cell proteomics by combining atomic mass spectrometry and reporter elements. We plan to compare the composition of immunological cell types in the microenvironment of the tumor and the host at time of diagnostic laparoscopy using a study-specific CyTOF panel of 38 antibodies representing the main classes of immune cells including T- and B-leukocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, as well as subtypes of T-lymphocytes and tumor cell-specific markers.";;;;;;;;"The high-dimensional data generated through the biologic examination will be analyzed using software in Cytobank and R. The focus will be on distinguishing populations present in the samples and the relative distribution of these, comparing samples taken before and after intake of the study medicine. Further, as revelation of phenotypically related cell subsets would be of great value, attempts to identify such will be made.";;;;;;;;Discussion;;;;;;;;"Currently we lack both specific identification of which women with HGSOC that will benefit from a particular treatment agent, as well as knowledge on how medicines affect the immunoscore in a primary setting. The result is suboptimal management of the disease in many women, unnecessary side effects for those without treatment effect, and faulty use of hospital resources.";;;;;;;;"Through this study we hope to detect changes in the immunoscore that correlates with effects of the administered medications. Such findings could help establish novel regimes for patients with HGSOC in a primary treatment setting.";;;;;;;;",Cytometry by Time of Flight, CyTOF, high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma, clinical trial, immunoscore""";;;;;;;;recreationally, while others use it as a mean of self medication against;;;;;;;;diseases that induce pain, or for relief of symptoms related to for example;;;;;;;;anxiety, stress, epilepsy and ADD/ADHD. However, cannabis may also induce;;;;;;;;psychosis. The molecular mechanisms by which cannabis could induce psychosis are not;;;;;;;;well understood. There are strong indications that it causes DNA methylation;;;;;;;;changes, although no-one has specifically tested this at the genome wide level.;;;;;;;;We have profiled methylation patterns in blood samples from different people;;;;;;;;"where some have been smoking cannabis. We have also transcriptomics information for the same individuals to characterise the effects of cannabis smoking on gene expression. We are now in the process of comparing the methylation patterns and gene expression of people that have smoked cannabis and people that have not. We are interested in identifying areas of the genome that have a changed expression and/or methylation pattern induced by cannabis. Our aim is to characterise the effect of cannabis at the molecular level and complement that with modelling in stem cells to understand the causality (and other mechanisms) linking cannabis use to the development of psychosis.
